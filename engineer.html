			<p>The elusive Software Engineer is a nocturnal creature, rarely
				found at their desks before 10 or 11 in the morning, but often
				staying late into the night. They dislike being interrupted while at
				work, and it is theorized that their penchant for twilight hours is
				an evolutionary adaptation to reduce breaks in their trance-like
				state of coding.</p>
			<p>Not surprisingly, Software Engineers are solitary creatures,
				except for occasional gatherings called "code rewievs." In these
				gatherings, engineers gently pace around a clearing, sizing up each
				other's work. Although occasional battles will erupt, they mostly
				end without injury and the engineer will retreat to their desk and
				continue to hibernate.</p>
